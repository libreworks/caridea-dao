/**
 * An exception for unmodifiable records due to business logic, not permissions.
 *
 * The typical use case here is when a record has been finalized and someone
 * tries to perform an update (e.g. once a record is submitted, it can't be
 * changed).
 *
 * Updates to records that are actually *locked* using pessimistic locking
 * should instead use the `Conflicting` exception.
